1)
	Make a function for get the correct number of examples that the generator give to us

	the function has to be structured like that

----->  VAR_num = read_from_info_file( VAR_file_name, VAR_gender, VAR_emotion):   <-------

	the function read the VAR_file_name and from that based on VAR_gender (M/F) and VAR_emotion (wich emotion we take) return the total number of example.


2)
	adapt the code of the generator for select the emotion that we want

3) 
	insert a new parameter in the generator to return tuple (X,Y) for test, and batch of tuple (X,Y)*32 fro train and validation
